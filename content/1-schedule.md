### Keynote Speakers 


#### T. LaRock: Encapsulation Structure and Dynamics in Hypergraphs

**Abstract**: Hypergraphs are a powerful modelling framework to represent systems where interactions may involve an arbitrary number of nodes. In this talk we will explore the extent to which smaller hyperedges are subsets of larger hyperedges in real-world and synthetic hypergraphs, a property that we call encapsulation. Building on the concept of line graphs, we develop measures to quantify the relations existing between hyperedges of different sizes and, as a byproduct, the compatibility of the data with a simplicial complex representationâ€“whose encapsulation would be maximum. We then turn to the impact of the observed structural patterns on diffusive dynamics, focusing on a variant of threshold models, called encapsulation dynamics, and demonstrate that non-random patterns can accelerate the spreading in the system.

#### J.M. Almeida: Applications of Network Backbone Extraction to Infer Information Dissemination Campaigns in Social Media

**Abstract**: The literature is quite rich in efforts to model and analyze how different aspects of user behavior may drive the dissemination of information online, favoring its spread at large. Yet, human behavior is often very heterogeneous, highly dynamic, and may manifest itself in multiple facets and scales. As such, inferring behavioral patterns and profiles from digital traces can be quite challenging. In this talk, I will discuss our efforts towards inferring, modeling and analyzing collective user behavior driving information dissemination campaigns. The core of our approach lies in the use of a network of pairwise interactions and a  backbone extraction method to identify a subset of the network edges most probably related to the phenomenon under study, namely the campaigns.  I will show results applied to the study of spread of fake news and hate speech, and  briefly discuss the challenges of extending such approach to hypernetwork models
