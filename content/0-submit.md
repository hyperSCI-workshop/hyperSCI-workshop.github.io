### What and How to Submit
HyperSCI accepts several types of submissions for review, including:

- *Full papers* (max 8 pages)
- *Short papers* (max 5 pages)
- *Extended Abstract* (max 2 pages)

### Submission Guidelines
Authors are invited to submit original research papers which have not been published elsewhere and which are not currently under consideration for another journal, conference, or workshop. Extended abstracts may present work that can be already published, in preparation for publication elsewhere, or ongoing research.

Paper submissions (full, short, and abstract) must use the [IEEE 2-column template](https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html), including bibliography and appendices. Submissions should include the title, author(s), affiliation(s), e-mail address(es), tel/fax numbers, abstract, and postal address(es) on the first page. 

The review process follows the guidelines of the [main conference](https://asonam.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/2024/CFP.php). At least two reviewers will evaluate submissions on the basis of relevance, technical quality, potential impact, and clarity.
To submit a paper, please use the following web portal.

HyperSCI Co-Chairs are also open to the possibility of publishing a **special issue of a journal** for the best papers of the workshop.
